{"name":"Booz Allen Cloud Broker","tagline":"The Open Cloud Broker","body":"#Official Release October 22, 2014\r\n\r\n##Welcome to Project Jellyfish\r\nJellyfish is Booz Allen Hamilton's hybrid, automated, and customizable cloud management and brokerage solution. Jellyfish helps administrators track resource utilization and costs, simplifies the process of requesting cloud resources, and reduces the time required to acquire services. As a result, organizations can effectively manage their increasing number of cloud resources to ensure compliance with security, cost, and time requirements.\r\n###Architecture\r\nJellyfish is made up of three components, the Cloud Portal, the Cloud Engine, and the Cloud Gateway. Each component serves a specific function, and when integrated together, they provide a flexible framework with the ability ot interface to multiple cloud providers behind a single portal.<br>\r\n**Cloud Portal**<br>\r\nThe Cloud Portal is a single pane of glass that users can use to browse and order a variety of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS resources from the customizable storefront catalog. It also serves as a single point of entry for administrators to login and manage marketplace resources and user accounts. The Cloud Portal is built using Drupal 7.24.<br>\r\n\r\n**Cloud Engine**<br>\r\nThe Cloud Engine provides the core automation capabilities of the cloud broker. The Jellyfish Cloud Engine uses  Apache ServiceMix 5.1.2 as the messaging engine and Chef as the configuration management engine.<br>\r\n\r\n**Cloud Gateway**<br>\r\nThe Cloud Gateway is ManageIQ, and it enables integration between the cloud broker and cloud providers. The Cloud Gateway provides multi-cloud provisioning and management capabilities as serves as a central point for all the user's cloud resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\n\r\n###Installing the Cookbooks\r\n\r\n1.
