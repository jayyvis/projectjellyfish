##Project Jellyfish: <br>An Open Source Cloud Services Broker Solution
###Why Jellyfish
Jellyfish play an important role in the oceanic food chain, and are responsible for helping maintain balance in the ocean’s delicate, complex ecosystem. They occupy every major ocean in the world, and are adept at withstanding a broad range of salinities and temperatures. Today’s organizations need equal versatility in its cloud service brokering. With Project Jellyfish, you can provision and manage all your on- and off-premise cloud services from a centralized, open source e-commerce platform.

###Why an Open Source Cloud Broker
Cloud computing has emerged as one of the most valuable technologies for managing the IT ecosystem. Yet the myriad of cloud services available can be overwhelming to administer effectively. The lack of standardization and cost tracking capabilities, as well as the risk of vendor lock-in, adds to your company’s everyday financial and operational challenges. <br>

*To help resolve these issues,* Booz Allen Hamilton developed Project Jellyfish, an open source cloud services broker solution that unifies your disparate cloud resources, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). This means automated and rapid service delivery, comprehensive performance and cost monitoring, standardized configuration management, and customizable workflows across public, private, or hybrid cloud platforms for overall improved business operations. Using an intuitive, e-commerce interface, Project Jellyfish provides a holistic reach into your entire inventory of virtualized assets — from the full catalog of services, to governance and compliance, to chargebacks. <br>

*The result is* a rapid self-service marketplace, reusable code, scalable infrastructure, and the ability to accurately track and report your company’s cloud services usage and costs. Project Jellyfish is revolutionizing today’s complex cloud ecosystem through open source to drive innovation, quality and efficiency.

##Architecture
Jellyfish is made up of three components, the Marketplace, the Cloud Engine, and the Cloud Gateway. Each component serves a specific function, and when integrated together, they provide a flexible framework with the ability to interface to multiple cloud providers behind a single portal.<br>

**Marketplace**<br>
The Marketplace is a single pane of glass that users can use to browse and order a variety of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS resources from the customizable storefront catalog. It also serves as a single point of entry for administrators to login and manage resources and user accounts. The Marketplace is built using Drupal 7.24.<br>

**Cloud Engine**<br>
The Cloud Engine provides the core automation capabilities of the cloud broker. The Jellyfish Cloud Engine uses  Apache ServiceMix 5.1.2 as the messaging engine and Chef as the configuration management engine.<br>

**Cloud Gateway**<br>
The Cloud Gateway is ManageIQ, and it enables integration between the cloud broker and cloud providers. The Cloud Gateway provides multi-cloud provisioning and management capabilities as serves as a central point for all the user's cloud resources.
